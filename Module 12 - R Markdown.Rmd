## RMarkdown

I have used R Markdown ever since the first day I started using RStudio and I much prefer it over the regular R console. I find it much more intuitive as well as organized and it makes creating neat documents with text and descriptions very easy and have used it for every assignment I have submitted thus far. I even use it for papers for non-R related classes such as for a paper in a writing class.

There are a ton of different formatting and output options in R Markdown such as *italics*, **bold**

And of course the ability to insert code and either hide the code itself, the output, both or neither through the parameters of the chunk. 

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

It also knits the documents in a neatly organized PDF, HTML or other downloadable templates such as APA format or as a GitHub export. 

There are countless ways to modify a document in RMarkdown but its flexibility and intuitiveness lets it create nearly any formatted document that you could imagine.
